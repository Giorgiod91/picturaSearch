# will use an ML image classifier

# What i need for the project

- ML backend with the model who can analyse the image and search for matching ones in the ebay database
- ebay database connection (dev account)
- image upload has to be possible
- python backend with flask
- database for users

# Machine Learning

- the model will eventually get better and better the more the users upload images
